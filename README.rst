About
=====

This is an ancient (by internet standards) implementation of Fortuna,
the continuously seeding pseudo-random number generator as described
by Bruce Schneier and Niels Ferguson in their book Practical
Cryptography. This implementation relies on OpenSSL for its
cryptographic primitives (``aptitude install libssl-dev`` on Debain
machines) and on pthread, should you desire threading.

Usage
=====

Don't. This was made for intellectual curiosity, nothing more.
